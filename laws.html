      <h1>The Laws of the North</h1>
      <p>
        The following statutes and codes govern all lords, knights, and smallfolk within the Kingdom of the North. These laws are interpreted and enforced by the Winter Court and local bannermen, and reflect centuries of tradition as well as contemporary edicts by His Grace, King Rykard Stark.

        <h2>Titles and Nobility</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>No one may style themselves as King, Prince, or Queen within the North unless named such by the ruling monarch of Winterfell.</li>
          <li>Only the King or Queen may name new Houses, legitimize bastards, or raise men to lordship.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="law-block">
        <h2>Justice and Punishment</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Justice is swift and carried out in the name of the King. Beheading is the customary sentence for treason.</li>
          <li>The right of trial by combat is reserved for lords, and only when sanctioned by the Winter Court.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="law-block">
        <h2>Fealty and Oaths</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Every noble sworn to Winterfell must maintain a trained retinue of men-at-arms for wartime muster.</li>
          <li>Breach of fealty is a high crime, to be judged before the King himself or his appointed Steward.</li>
